## [Unreleased]

- _No changes yet._

## [0.18.0] - 2025-11-26

### Added
- **Zig adapter (Alpha)** – debugging support for Zig programs via lldb-dap, including build integration and DWARF debug info
- **Pause execution support** – ability to pause running debug sessions via `pause_execution` tool
- **Conditional breakpoint integration tests** – comprehensive test coverage for conditional breakpoints across all 4 languages (Python, JavaScript, Rust, Zig)
- **Comprehensive Zig documentation** – `docs/zig-setup.md` setup guide, `docs/zig-debugging.md` debugging guide, and `examples/zig-harness/README.md`
- **Language-specific condition syntax documentation** – documented LLDB expression syntax requirements for Rust/Zig adapters

### Improved
- **Expression evaluation** – rich object previews with automatic property expansion, smart truncation for large results
- **Cross-language error handling** – structured error reporting with category, message, and actionable suggestions for JS (ReferenceError/SyntaxError) and LLDB adapters (undeclared identifier)
- **Conditional breakpoint feedback** – added `conditionVerified` and `conditionError` fields to breakpoint response for better UX

## [0.17.0] - 2025-11-22

### Added
- **Rust adapter (Alpha)** – integrates CodeLLDB to support Cargo projects, async runtimes, and cross-platform execution with smart rebuild detection

### Improved
- **Stepping UX** – every `step_*` response now embeds current source context so agents see the active file/line instead of generic “success” acknowledgements

### Packaging
- **CodeLLDB footprint** – CLI bundle ships the Linux x64 CodeLLDB runtime by default (other platforms can point `CODELLDB_PATH` to an installed binary or re-run the vendor script) to stay within npm size limits

## [0.16.0] - 2025-11-09

### Added
- **JavaScript adapter (Alpha)** – full debugging loop backed by bundled `js-debug`, TypeScript detector, and adapter policy orchestration
- **Adapter documentation** – updated `docs/javascript/*` guides covering architecture, source maps, and usage
- **Proxy session analytics** – dry-run/handshake instrumentation persisted in logs for CI triage

### Changed
- **Build system** – migrated CLI bundling from esbuild to tsup (`noExternal: [/./]`) for deterministic workspace packaging
  - Produces self-contained `@debugmcp/mcp-debugger` bundles and trims install size
  - Simplifies npx execution by embedding adapter assets
- **Proxy bundling** – emitted dedicated `proxy-bundle.cjs` process with automatic runtime detection of bundled vs dev mode
- **Adapter wiring** – session manager now loads adapters via registry/policies, enabling future language additions

### Fixed
- Resolved missing dependency errors when running via `npx` (fs-extra, etc.)
- Ensured proxy bootstrap locates `js-debug` artifacts in bundled distributions
- Hardened Windows dry-run handling to avoid silent exits

### Improved
- **npx distribution** – zero-runtime dependencies; CLI bundle (~3 MB) includes all workspace packages, proxy bundle ships with required modules
- **Build performance** – faster incremental builds with tsup and shared cache
- **Deployment simplicity** – single command `npx @debugmcp/mcp-debugger stdio` “just works”; Docker image consumes same artifact layout
- **Documentation footprint** – refreshed build pipeline notes (`docs/development/build-pipeline.md`) and architecture overview

### Added

- Initial public release of `debug-mcp-server`.
- Core functionality for Python debugging using the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP) via `debugpy`.
- MCP server implementation with tools for:
    - Creating and managing debug sessions (`create_debug_session`, `list_debug_sessions`, `close_debug_session`).
    - Debug actions: `set_breakpoint`, `start_debugging`, `step_over`, `step_into`, `step_out`, `continue_execution`.
    - State inspection: `get_stack_trace`, `get_scopes`, `get_variables`.
- Support for both STDIN/STDOUT and HTTP transport for MCP communication.
- Basic CLI to start the server with transport and logging options.
- Python "launcher" package (`debug-mcp-server-launcher`) for PyPI, to aid users in running the server and ensuring `debugpy` is available.
- Dockerfile for building and running the server in a containerized environment, including OCI labels.
- GitHub Actions CI setup for:
    - Building and testing on Ubuntu and Windows.
    - Linting with ESLint.
    - Publishing Docker image to Docker Hub on version tags.
    - Publishing Python launcher package to PyPI on version tags.
- Project structure including:
    - `LICENSE` (MIT).
    - `CONTRIBUTING.md` (basic template).
    - GitHub issue and pull request templates.
    - `README.md` with quick start, features, and usage instructions.
    - `docs/` directory with initial documentation (`quickstart.md`).
    - `examples/` directory with:
        - `python_simple_swap/`: A buggy Python script and a demo script showing how to debug it using MCP tools.
        - `agent_demo.py`: A minimal example of an LLM agent loop interacting with the server.
- Unit and integration tests for core functionality. (E2E tests for HTTP transport are currently skipped due to environment complexities).
- `pyproject.toml` for the Python launcher and `package.json` for the Node.js server.

### Changed

- Build output directory standardized to `dist/`.

### Known Issues

- E2E tests for HTTP transport (`tests/e2e/debugpy-connection.test.ts`) are temporarily skipped due to challenges with JavaScript environment setup (fetch/ReadableStream polyfills in Jest/JSDOM). These will be revisited.
- Placeholder URLs and names (e.g., for repository, Docker Hub user, author) in `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Dockerfile`, `README.md`, and example scripts need to be updated with actual project details.
